ðŸ”§ Setup: Preparing the Application

Before using the tool, you must first configure and create the executable file.

    Unzip the Bulk Password Reset file to a folder on your computer.

    Open the PowerShell script, BulkPasswordReset-final.ps1, using any text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, etc.).

    Go to line 394 and change the placeholder domain name to your actual domain name. Save the file.

    Open PowerShell as an Administrator.

    Run the following command to create the executable (.exe) file. Make sure to replace the example paths with the actual file path on your system:

        Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile "C:\path\to\your\file\BulkPasswordReset-final.ps1" -OutputFile "C:\path\to\your\file\BulkPasswordReset.exe"


Resetting a Single User's Password

    Open the BulkPasswordReset.exe application you just created.

    Select your domain from the dropdown menu.

    Change the credentials if required.

    Select the OU (Organisational Unit) where the user account is located.

    Search for the user by their SAM Account Name, Display Name, or UPN. The user will be automatically highlighted in the list.

    Type the new password and then confirm it.

    Click Reset Password to update the password for the selected user.


Resetting Passwords in Bulk

    Open the BulkPasswordReset.exe application.

    Select your domain and change credentials if needed.

    Prepare your user list in a CSV file. You can use the sample provided in the zip file or create a new one.

        Important: The CSV file must contain a column with the header SamAccountName.

    Click Browse to select your CSV user list.

    Enter the new password that will be set for all users in the file.

    Click Run Bulk Password Reset.

        Note: The "User must change password at next logon" option is automatically enabled for all users processed in bulk.

    Once finished, you can export the Result if you need a log of the changes.

Enjoy the app! ðŸŽ‰
